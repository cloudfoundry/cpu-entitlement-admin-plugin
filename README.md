# ⚠️ This plugin is deprecated ⚠️
There is now a CPU entitlement metric in CF CLI. In CF CLI v8 there is a new column "CPU Entitlement". In CF CLI v9+ this "CPU Entitlemnet metric" will replace the previous "CPU" metric. You read more about it in the [github issue here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/2812).
